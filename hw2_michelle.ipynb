    "\n",
    "1. Write a bigrams feature function, on the model of `unigrams_phi`. Call this `bigrams_phi`. In writing this function, ensure that each example is padded with start and end symbols (say, `<S>` and `</S>`), so that these contexts are properly reflected in the feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a function `fit_nb_classifier_with_crossvalidation` that serves as a wrapper for `sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB` and searches over these values for the smoothing parameter `alpha`: `[0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0]`, using 3-fold cross-validation.\n",

    "1. The average F1 score that `sst.experiment` reported.\n",

    "__A note on performance__: in our experience, the bigrams Naive Bayes model gets around 0.75. It's fine to submit answers with comparable numbers; the Socher et al. baselines are very strong. We're not evaluating how good your model is; we want to see your code, and we're interested to see what the range of F1 scores is across the whole class."
